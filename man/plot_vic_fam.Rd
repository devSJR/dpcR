Amplitude Plot VIC and FAM Channels of a Droplet Digital PCR Experiment
}
\description{
This function generates an amplitude plot of two fluorescence channels as found in droplet digital
PCR.

}
  \item{fam}{
    Amplitudes of the FAM channel - object of class \code{\linkS4class{ddpcr}}.
}
  \item{col_vic}{
    Color of the VIC channel.

\details{
Droplet digital PCR experiments consist of three steps (droplet generation, clonal amplification, 
droplet amplitude analysis). Typically 20000 nano-sized droplets are analyzed and separated into 
amplification-positive and amplification-negative droplets. An example of such system is the 
Bio-Rad QX100 and QX200 (Pinheiro et al. 2012). Such systems have applications in the detection of
rare DNA target copies, the determination of copy number variations (CNV), detection of mutation,
or expression analysis of genes or miRNA. Each droplet is analyzed individually using a virtual 
two-color detection system. The channels are treated separately but finally aligned (e.g., FAM 
and VIC or FAM and HEX).

# Generate an amplitude plot for the first fluorescence channel (e.g., FAM)
fluos1 <- sim_ddpcr(m = 16, n = 30, times = 100, pos_sums = FALSE, n_exp = 1, 
  fluo = list(0.1, 0))

# Generate an amplitude plot for the second fluorescence channel (e.g., VIC)
fluos2 <- sim_ddpcr(m = 16, n = 30, times = 100, pos_sums = FALSE, n_exp = 1, 
  fluo = list(0.1, 0))

# Plot the amplitudes of both fluorescence channel in an aligned fashion
plot_vic_fam(fam = fluos1, vic = fluos2)

# Same as above but diffrent colors
plot_vic_fam(fam = fluos1, vic = fluos2, col_vic = "red", col_fam = "yellow")

# Generate two channels in one object and plot them
fluos_both <- sim_ddpcr(m = 16, n = 30, times = 100, pos_sums = FALSE, n_exp = 2, 
  fluo = list(0.1, 0))
